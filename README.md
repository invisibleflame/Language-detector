# Language-detector

A simple FC language detector model. The accuracy achieved was 95.5%. The code is fully customisable and the number of languages and the data can be changed easily.

The data is scraped from Wikipedia based on the CONFIG
The data is cleaned and then the words are separated and converted to encoded vectors.
Then a FC model is used to make the predictions and the probability for each language is given as output.
